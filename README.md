# OFDM-Transmitters
This MATLAB-based project implements a 5G OFDM transmitter by performing bitstream encoding, modulation (BPSK, Pi/2 BPSK, QPSK, 64QAM), serial-to-parallel conversion, IFFT, and cyclic prefix insertion. The project generates time-domain plots of OFDM symbols and includes a direct up-conversion circuit diagram for RF transmission.
